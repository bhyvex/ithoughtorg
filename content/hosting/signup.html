<h1>Hosting Signup</h1>
<p>Just click the "buy" now button on the payment page and email ckdake at ckdake dot com the info about what you want hosted. What websites and subdomains (and if you need me to purchase them for you), what you'd like your SSH username(s) to be, and anything else you can think of. You'll get an email back with any more information needed or instructions for you, and generally you will be up and running within 30 minutes of getting ithought all the required information. Sometimes it takes longer at night or on weekends.</p>
